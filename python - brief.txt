Brief for Python Script:
--------------------------

Stage 1 - Read File + Database Calls:
(theoretically could skip this step first bc transforming db response into export.csv will be difficult)
Read in the file from directory, I will save it manually from roger's email
fetch UUID list from csv, go off to middleware db with that usual huge query, and somehow see if I can format the response into a csv file somehow


Stage 2 - Take export.csv and perform file formatting on it:
Read in the export.csv we have created
Replace all end of line LF characters with nothing
replace all soap body openings and closings
search through document and somehow remove all commas that aren't those first 2 on each line.
search through document for <ns2:phone and <ns2:post, and notify me whether they meet the criteria for being number or not
OPTIONAL:
make function that replaces all O's with 0's to try fix the phone number
can eventually add more functionality here to web scrape google for the address, and try find the postcode for me
export final file to new final export.csv


Stage 3 - sending out through JMeter:
could eventually try to automate the JMeter part, but would need to figure out how tf it is sending soap requests, etc. and how to do that in python, then just loop through all the records inside the csv and push them to prod for retrying.
